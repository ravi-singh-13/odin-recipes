    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
        Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
        From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
        Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).</li>
        <li>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.</li>
        <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.

            Remove from heat.</li>
    </ol>
